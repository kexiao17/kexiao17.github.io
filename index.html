                <h2>Ke Xiao</h2>
                <p>I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Ph.D student in the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home" 
                   target="_blank"<b>Information Fusion Lab</b></a> of Computer Science Department at UMass Amherst, 
                   advised by <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/fiterau-brostean-madalina" 
                   target="_blank">Prof. Madalina Fiterau</a>.
                   
                   My primary research interests resides in the field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, 
                   Weak Supervision, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics. <a href="pdf/cv.pdf" download>CV</a></p>

                <p>Currently I am doing computer vision research on medical imaging datasets, most of which come from the 
                   <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK Biobank</a>.
                   The task at hand is classifying Mitral Regurgitation with mostly unlabeled cardiac MRI datasets from 
                   the UK Biobank. The pipeline consists of a multi-view CNN-LSTM classification model, a ensemble model trained
                   with weak probabilistic labels generated with multiple heuristic functions, and a U-Net based segmentation model
                   segmenting the cardiac MRI data for the CNN-LSTM classification model as well as for the heuristic functions.</p>

                <p>Before coming to UMass, I was working on medical imaging computer vision research in the 
                   <a href="https://priestlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Priest Lab</a> at Stanford University, 
                   supervised/advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/james-priest" 
                   target="_blank">Dr. James R. Priest</a>, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jfries/" 
                   target="_blank">Dr. Jason A. Fries</a>, and Prof. Madalina Fiterau. We worked on a variety of research projects 
                   using cardiac MRI datasets, among which the work of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11012-3" target="_blank">Aortic Valve Malformation Classification</a> 
                   was published at Nature Communications in 2019.</p>

                <p>Before I ventured into computer vision research, I worked on robotics research at Colorado School of Mines 
                   where I graduated with a Master's degree in <em>Robotics, Automation, and Design</em> from the 
                   Mechanical Engineering department. Even though my current research interests are focused on computer vision and
                   weak supervision, I would still welcome the opportunity to research in an interdisciplinary area involving 
                   both computer vision and robotics.</p>

                <p>Outside of the research lab, I like to spend my time in nature. I enjoy activities such as surfing, 
                   skydiving, scuba diving, hiking, road tripping, and more. And when I can not venture far, I like to swim, 
                   play guitar, practice yoga, etc.</p>
