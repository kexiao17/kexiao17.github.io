                <h2>Ke Xiao</h2>
                <p>I am a first-year Ph.D student in the Information Fusion Lab of Computer Science Department at UMass Amherst, 
                   advised by <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/fiterau-brostean-madalina">Prof. Madalina Fiterau</a>.
                   My primary research interests resides in the field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics.</p>

                <p>I am currently doing computer vision research on medical imaging datasets, most of which come from <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a>.
                   I am developing an automated pipeline consisting of a multi-view CNN-LSTM classification model, U-Net based segmentation model, 
                   and a Random Forest ensemble model.</p>

                <p>Before coming to UMass, I was working on computer vision research on medical imaging in <a href="https://priestlab.stanford.edu/">Priest Lab</a> 
                   at Stanford University, supervised/advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/james-priest">Dr. James R. Priest</a>, 
                   <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~jfries/">Dr. Jason A. Fries</a>. We worked a variety of research projects on cardiac MRI datasets.
                   The work of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11012-3">Aortic Valve Malformation Classification</a> is published at 
                   Nature Communications.</p>

                <p>Before I ventured into computer vision research, I worked on robotics research at Colorado School of Mines where I graduated with a Master's degree
                   on Robotics, Automation, and Design in Mechanical Engineering department. Beyond the current computer vision research I work on, I still retain
                   my research interests on robotics.</p>

                <p>Like my adventuring spirits in research, I like to adventure in my free time as well, which includes surfing, skydiving, scuba diving, hiking, 
                   road tripping, and more. When I can not venture far, I like to swim, play guitar, practice yoga, etc.</p>
